Problem Stament : 
Given an integer x, return "true" if x is a palindrome "false" otherwise.

Plindrome :-
------------
An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same forward and backward.
For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.

Example 1 : 
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2 :
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. 
From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome
